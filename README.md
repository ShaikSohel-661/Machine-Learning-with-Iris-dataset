# Machine-Learning-with-Iris-dataset
In this Iris machine learning project I have done classification task involving the Iris flower dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. It consists of measurements of four attributes of different iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the iris flowers into their respective species based on these attribute measurements. The dataset contains three classes: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, representing three different species of iris flowers.
Step-by-step process
1.Data Preprocessing: loading the dataset and performing some initial exploratory data analysis. Check for missing values, outliers, or any inconsistencies in the data. 
2.Data Visualization: Visualizing the dataset using libraries like seaborn, matplotlib to gain insights into the relationships between different attributes and the class labels. This can help to understand the data distribution and identify any patterns or separability between the classes.
3.Model Training: Spliting the dataset into training and testing sets. Training chosen model on the training set and tune its hyperparameters if necessary. 
4.Model Selection: Selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm for our classification task using sklearn. In this project I have used several Machine Learning classification  algorithms like Logistic regression, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.
5.Deployment and Testing: After we are satisfied with the performance of our model, we can deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
6.Accuracy Test: Checking the accuracy of each model using matrics from sklearn
